# Go code examples

To test a code example, open a terminal and ```$ cd ``` into the desired directory, then just run the Go file. 
For example, to run the ```channels.go``` file:

- ```$ cd concurrency/channels``` to navigate into the ```channels``` directory
- ```$ go run channels.go``` to run the Go file
